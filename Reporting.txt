1. What hurdles have you faced so far?


I didn’t really know how to approach printing the questions one by one. I tried to do it actually one by one, but it got tedious/repetitive.


2. How did you solve them?


I researched and remembered that I can use echo in a vector sense where each line aligns with an index. 


3. What are you next steps?


I need to put it in GitHub and make sure it’s user-friendly!
